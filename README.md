# Decision Tree Computations

Just a simple set of scripts I needed in order to compute the information gain of each attribute within a table containing training data. Thought I would share it with the world in case anyone else needs to compute these values. I used python 3.5. This is for the ID3 algorithm and it's only for one binary class.
